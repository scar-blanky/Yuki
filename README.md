# Project Yuki :ghost:
A spending tracker app. <br>
The reason why it's called Yuki is because I've been buying too many Yuki goods lately. :sob:

I intend to host this on Google Cloud Platform when I am done implementing some basic features.

# Run 
After putting the correct fields into `.env`, with Node 24+, a simple `npm run dev` should be all it needs. No `npm i` needed nihahaha. XD
